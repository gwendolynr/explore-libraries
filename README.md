RStudio::conf training days

This is the readme for the rstudio::conf training day with Jenny Bryan. She is teaching us a class on "What they didn't teach you about R", which is a git heavy course. As part of the course, we are learning how to enable github pages so we can make mini websites. Pretty cool/easy.
